Program 01 :
------------
Create a BLC(Business Logic Class) called Bowler. Add below details to the class. 

1. Instance variables:
 bowlerName: String
 bowlerWickets: int
 bowlerMatches: int,
 balls_bowled: int,
 runs_conceded: int. 

2. Method : bowlerDetails() : public void

Create a method name called bowlerDetails() that accepts name, wickets, matches, ballsbowled and runsConceded as a parameter to initialize the field.

Method name: bowlerDetails : public void

3. Create below public methods,
 Method name: computeBowlingAverage
 Return type: void

 This method should print the bowling average of the bowler by dividing runs_conceded with wickets.

 Input:
 name = "Abhishek Sharma",
 wickets = 10,
 matches = 5,
 balls_bowled = 750,
 runs_conceded 463.

 Output:
 Name: Abhishek Sharma
 bowling_avg=46.3
 Note: a. If any values are negative print 'Error'.

 b. If runs_conceded or balls_bowled are greater than 0 when matches are 0 print 'Error'.

 Method name: computeStrikeRate
 Return type: void

This method should print the Strike Rate of the bowler by dividing runs_conceded with balls_bowled.

 Input:
 name = "Abhishek Sharma",
 wickets = 10,
 matches = 5,
 balls_bowled = 750,
 runs_conceded 463.

 Output:
 Name: Abhishek Sharma
 Strike_rate=0.61733335
 Note: a. If any values are negative print 'Error'.

 b. If runs_conceded or balls_bowled are greater than 0 when matches are 0 print 'Error'.

 Method name: showStatistics
 Return type: void

 This method should print the details of the batter.
 Input:
 name = "Sachin",
 wickets = 10,
 matches = 5,
 balls_bowled = 750,
 runs_conceded 463.

 Output:
 Name=Sachin
 wickets=10
 matches=5

 balls_bowled=750
 runs_conceded=463

 Note: a. If any values are negative print 'Error'.

 b. If runs_conceded or balls_bowled are greater than 0 when matches are 0 print 'Error'.

Program 02 :
------------
Class Batter is given to you. Add below details to the class

 1. Instance variables:
 batterName: String,
 batterRuns: int,
 batterMatches: int,
 batting_avg: double.

2. Method batterDetails() : public void

Create a method name called batterDetails() that accepts name, runs, matches.

Method name: batterDetails : public void

 3. Create below public methods,
 Method name: computeBattingAverage
 Return type: void

 This method should print the batting average of the batter by dividing run with matches.

 Input: 

 Name: "Abhishek Sharma"
 Runs: 18000
 Matches: 463



 Output:
 Name: Abhishek Sharma
 Batting_Avg: 38.87689

 Note: a. If runs or matches values are negative print 'Error'.

 b. If runs are greater than 0 when matches are 0 print 'Error'.

 Method name: getStatistics
 Return type: void
 This method should print the details of the batter.

 Input: 
Name: "Abhishek Sharma"
Runs: 18000
Matches: 463

 Output:
 Name: Abhishek Sharma
 Runs: 18000
 Matches: 463


 Note: a. If runs or matches values are negative print 'Error'.
 b. If runs are greater than 0 when matches are 0 print 'Error'.
