                                SEQUENCE
                              ===========

     Sequence is an database object which is used to 
generates Sequence of numbers automatically. 

      Generally sequences are used to generates Primary key values
automatically. Generally sequence is an independent database object.
That's why Once a sequence has been created then number of users
simultaneously access that sequence.

   in oracle if we want to generate first sequence number then
we must use nextval pseudo column because currval pseudo column
returns current value of sequence session if sequence session
already having a value

syntax:-
=======
select sequencename.nextval from dual;



1.What is Sequence ? What is main purpose of Sequence?



2.Create a sequence ?Sequence stat with 5 and generate values
  upto 10

***Generating primary key values automatically(Auto-increment):-
 * ===========================================================

     In all relational databases generating primary key values
automatically is called auto-increment concept.in oracle we are
implementing auto-increment concept by using sequence database 
object.

3.Genarate the primary key values for the following column sno
  by using sequence.




SQL>create table test12(sno number(10) primary key,name varchar2(10));

---->create a sequence first 
---->create the table test12 table as shown in above
---->insert into test12(sno,name)values(s1.nextval,'&name');
---->only we are proving the values to name column.by using
     sequence pseudo column nextval we are generating values 
     automatically to sno column.


---->after inserting the records add RNO column
---->alter table test12 add rollno number(10);

XSNO      NAME        RNO
---     ------     --------
1        GOWTHAM     
2        SUBBARAO  
3        RAJU        
4        KIRAN  

---->create one more sequence s2 and stating value is 73     

---->by using one update command with sequence pseudo 
     column(nextval) generate the output as follows

SNO      NAME       RNO
---     ------     --------
1        GOWTHAM     73
2        SUBBARAO    74
3        RAJU        75
4        KIRAN       76



4.NOTE:-Oracle 12c onwards we can also use sequence pseudo columns
        with in default clause

syntax:-
=======
columnname number(size) default sequencename.nextval primary key

--->Create a sequence first and sequence start with 1001
--->Create table BANK123 with ACCNO column by using above syntax
    and NAME,BAL columns
--->Insert the values only NAME,BAL columns by using 
    skipping columns method
--->And observe the output and beauty of sequence

NOTE:-This kind of EXAMPLE is very useful in Advance Java JDBC


5.Can we alter sequence parameter values ?

create a sequence with
--->start with 5
--->increment by 1
--->minvalue 4
--->maxvalue 100

Then generate 5 sequence values.after generating sequence values,
alter sequence parameter value increment by -1
then again generate the values.see the output

         
6.What is cache ? what is default size of cache?
