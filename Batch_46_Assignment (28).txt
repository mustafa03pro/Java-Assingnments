Develop a scenario based program by using interface for processing the payment 
using different available options like Credit Card and Debit Card and UPI Payment. Provide loose coupling through interface.
 
Create a sealed interface called Payment.
An end user can make a payment through CreditCard OR DebitCard OR UPI. No other payment mode is allowed.

Methods of Payment interface :
------------------------------
 void makePayment(double amount);
 void makeRefund(double amount);
 
Create a BLC class called CreditCardPayment which implements from Payment interface.

Fields :
cardHolderName : String private

Use a parameterized constructor to initialize the field.

Override all the abstract methods from Payment interface to write the business logic.



Create another BLC class called DebitCardPayment which implements from Payment interface.

Fields :
bankName : String private

Use a parameterized constructor to initialize the field.

Override all the abstract methods from Payment interface to write the business logic.



Create another BLC class called UPIPayment which implements from Payment interface.

Fields :
upiId : String private

Use a parameterized constructor to initialize the field.

Override all the abstract methods from Payment interface to write the business logic.



Create another BLC class ShoppingCart which provides loose coupling.

Fields :
totalAmount : double private [The total bill amount we need to pay]

Use parameterized constructor to initialize the field.

Methods :
---------    
    1) Method Name 		: checkout()
       Argument   		: One argument of type Payment
       Return Type 		: void
       Access modifier		: public
       In this method write a logic to make payment using dynamic polymorphism

   2) Method Name 		: cancelOrder()
       Argument   		: One argument of type Payment
       Return Type 		: void
       Access modifier		: public
       In this method write a logic to initiate the refund process using dynamic polymorphism



Create an ELC class Customer with main method to test this application. Write 
Switch case with Scanner class to test the working of this application as shown in the below Test Cases.
