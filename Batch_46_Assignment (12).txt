---------------
Create a BLC class Employee. 

Field/Attribute/Properties [Access modifier : private]

name : String
id : int
department : String
salary : double

Take a private parameterized constructor to initialize the field so, We can call the Constructor from BLC class only.

Methods :
----------
1)
Name of the Method : createEmployeeObject()
         Parameter : No Parameter 
       return type : Employee
   Access modifier : public
   Non access modifier : static

Prompt the user to enter values for name, id, department and salary.
Initialize a new Employee object with the provided values.
Return the created Employee object.

2) Generate toString() method. Call calculateAnnualSalary() method from
   this method to display deatils.

3)
Name of the Method : calculateAnnualSalary()
         Parameter : No Parameter 
       return type : double
   Access modifier : public
  
In this method with the help of switch case calculates and returns the annual salary of the employee based on their salary (monthly salary).
Adds a bonus based on the department:
Sales: 10% bonus of annual salary.
Engineering: 15% bonus of annual salary.
HR: 8% bonus of annual salary.
Other: 5% bonus of annual salary.

Create an ELC class TestEmployee with Main Method:

Ask the user how many Employee objects they want to create.
Use a loop to call createEmployeeObject() to create the specified number of employees to print the deatils as shown in the Test case.

Test Case :
-------------

Assignment : 02
---------------
Create a BLC class Product. 

Field/Attribute/Properties [Access modifier : private]

id : int
name : String
price : double
quantity : int

Take a private parameterized constructor to initialize the field so, We can call the Constructor from BLC class only.


Methods :
----------
1)
Name of the Method : createProductObject()
         Parameter : No Parameter 
       return type : Product
   Access modifier : public
   Non access modifier : static

Prompt the user to enter values for id, name, price and quantity.
Initialize a new Prodcut object with the provided values.
Return the created Product object.

2) Generate toString() method. Call createProductObject() method from toString method to display deatils.


3)
Name of the Method : calculateTotalAmount()
         Parameter : No Parameter 
       return type : double
   Access modifier : public

In this method calculate the total amount for the product (price * quantity) 

Applies a discount based on the total amount:
If total > 1000: 10% discount.
Total > 500: 5% discount.
Total <= 500: No discount.
Returns the total amount after applying the discount.

Create a ELC class TestProduct:
Main Method:

Ask the user how many Product objects they want to create.
Use a loop to call createProduct() with parameters provided by the user to create each product.

Test Case :
-----------
