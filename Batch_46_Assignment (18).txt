Q1 : Simple Inheritance Program :
-------------------------------------
Develop one program on Multi-level Inheritance with following requirements :

Animal => Mammal => Dog [Multi-level Inheritance]

Create a BLC class called Animal.

Attributes/Properties: No properties

Constructor:
No Constructor 

Methods:

public void eat() : Method to print that "Animal is eating"

Create Another BLC class Mammal which is the sub class of Animal.

Attributes/Properties: No properties

Constructor:
No Constructor 

Methods:

public void walk() : Method to print that "Mammal is walking"


Create Another class Dog which is the sub class of Mammal.

Attributes/Properties: No properties

Constructor:
No Constructor 

Methods:

public void bark() : Method to print that "Dog is barking"


Create an ELC class MultilevelInheritance which contains main method, Create the Object for more specialized class and call the behavior.

========================================================================
Q2)

In a virtual zoo management system, you need to organize and categorize various types of animals to efficiently manage their characteristics and behaviors. 

To achieve this, you decide to implement a class hierarchy using multilevel inheritance.

1. Create the Animal Class
Requirements:
Define a private String attribute named name.
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name.
Implement getter and setter methods for name.


2. Create the Mammal Class
Requirements:
Extend the Animal class.
Add a private boolean attribute named hasFur.
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name (from Animal) and hasFur.
Implement getter and setter methods for hasFur.


3. Create the Dog Class
Requirements:
Extend the Mammal class.
Add a private String attribute named breed.
Implement a parameterized constructor to initialize name, hasFur (from Mammal), and breed.
Implement getter and setter methods for breed.
Generate toString() method to display all the Animal Details.In this method display all the Animal Details.

4. Create the Main Class which is an ELC class.

Create an instance of the Dog class.
Display details of the Dog object to demonstrate inheritance.

TEST CASE 1 :
-------------
sample input : Dog dog = new Dog("Tommy", true, "Bulldog");
               
sample output : 
              Dog [getName()=Tommy, isHasFur()=true, breed=Bulldog]
