Create a Employee Salary calculation Application project by using Method Overriding Concept to 
display
different kinds of salary for PartTimeEmployee and FullTimeEmployee.
Validate all the inputs properly and generate error message, if any input is not appropriate. 

Create a BLC class called Employee
Fields :
 id  int  protected
 name String protected
	
Use a parameterized constructor to initialize all the fields, 

 Methods :
 
 1) Method Name 	: calculateSalary()
    Argument   		: No Argument
    Return Type 	: double
    Access modifier	: public
    In this method return 0.0 for generic salary

 Create another BLC class FullTimeEmployee which is sub class of Employee.

  
  Field :
  protected double salary;
  
  Take a parameterized constructor to initialize super class and sub class properties.
  Validate all the inputs properly and generate error message, if any input is not appropriate. 
  [See the Test cases for Input Validation]

 Method :
  
 1) Method Name 	: calculateSalary()
    Argument   		: No Argument
    Return Type 	: double
